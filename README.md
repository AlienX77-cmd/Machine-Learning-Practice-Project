# Machine-Learning-Practice-Project
For Practicing Machine Learning Projects (including the datasets) that I have learnt

List of Practice Projects:
- Diabetes Prediction (using diabetes.csv datasets and Support Vector Machine model)
- Movies Recommendation System (using movies.csv datasets and Cosine Similarity model)
- Big Mart Sales Prediction (using big_mart_data.csv datasets and XGBoost Regressor model)
- Customer Segmentation (using Mall_Customers.csv datasets and K-Means Clustering model)
- Calories Burnt Prediction (using calories.csv and exercise.csv datasets and XGBoost Regressor model)
- Breast Cancer Classification (using Logistic Regression model)

List of ML concepts:
- GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
- Model Selection Concept
