# Machine-Learning-Practice-Project
For Practicing Machine Learning Projects (including the datasets) that I have learnt

- Movies Recommendation System (using movies.csv datasets and Cosine similarity model)
- Big Mart Sales Prediction (using big_mart_data.csv datasets and XGBoost Regressor model)
- Customer Segmentation (using Mall_Customers.csv datasets and K-Means Clustering model)
- Calories Burnt Prediction (using calories.csv and exercise.csv datasets and XGBoost Regressor model)
- Breast Cancer Classification (using Logistic Regression model)
